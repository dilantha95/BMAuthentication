Biometric Authentication scheme using Java

This is a project related to the course CS3052 - Computer Security and the main expectation of this project is to develop a scheme for biometric identification using java without using any library routines.

The biometric authentication method used for this project is identifying the key stroke pattern of the user.
Key stroke pattern can be identified by,

    1. the flying time between key presses/releases (flight time/up-to-up time)
    2. time betwwen a key press and a release (dwell time)
    3. prefered method for uppercases (caps lock/left shift/right shift) - to be added
